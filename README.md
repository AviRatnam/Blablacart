# BlablaCart Sample UI

BlablaCart is a fictional shopping website, intended to simulate a real online-shopping website.
 
  - To simulate the products, the Fake Store API has been used. It can be accessed here: https://fakestoreapi.com/
  - If you'd like to view the website, it's been hosted here: https://blablacart.vercel.app/

### Please run `npx json-server --watch data/cart.json --port 8000` to access the cart.

Some key points to note:

  - The 'delete' request in the shopping cart pop-up returns a 404 error, not sure why. 
  - I am aware most of the pipelining of props could've been avoided by using Redux, however I'm not fully comfortable in the same (yet).
  - Please let me know how the UI can be improved.
 
 Thank you!
