# BlablaCart Sample UI

BlablaCart is a fictional shopping website, intended to simulate a real online-shopping website.
 - The entire website is built using React JS along with TailwindCSS for the styling.
 - No external pre-styled components have been used; everything is styled by me.
 - To simlate the products, the Fake Store API has been used. It can be accessed here: https://fakestoreapi.com/
 - To run the app, you can simply run `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm run start` to run the app.
 - If you'd like to view the website, it's been hosted here: https://blablacart.vercel.app/
 
 Thank you!
